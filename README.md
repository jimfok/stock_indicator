# Stock Indicator

## Project Description
Stock Indicator provides a collection of Python utilities for computing common technical indicators used in stock market analysis. The goal is to make it easy to calculate metrics such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD on historical price data.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency and environment management
- Internet connection for downloading market data from providers like [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) or [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock_indicator.git
cd stock_indicator
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

`uv sync` creates the project-local virtual environment in `.venv` and installs
the dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`. You can skip manual activation by
using `uv run <command>` when running one-off scripts:

```bash
uv run python -m stock_indicator.manage --help
```

### VS Code and Codex CLI
- The project expects the virtual environment at `.venv`; run `source .venv/bin/activate` in each new VS Code terminal session.
- Run `uv sync` whenever dependencies change or the lock file updates.
- Use `uv run` for ad-hoc commands (`uv run pytest`, `uv run python -m stock_indicator.cli ...`) when activation is inconvenient.
- Configure VS Code's interpreter path to `.venv/bin/python` (or `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe` on Windows) so linting and tests reuse the synced environment.

### Migrating from a pip Workflow
If you previously managed dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, follow these steps to switch to uv:

```bash
# Install uv (one time). Replace python3 with the interpreter you used previously.
python3 -m pip install --upgrade uv

# Deactivate and remove the old virtual environment if it exists.
deactivate 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf .venv

# Recreate the environment and install dependencies through uv.
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

After the migration, run project commands with `uv run` or the activated `.venv` to keep everything in sync with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

### Example Usage
```python
from stock_indicator.data_loader import download_history
from stock_indicator.indicators import rsi

prices = download_history("AAPL", "2023-01-01", "2023-06-01")
prices["rsi_14"] = rsi(prices["close"], window=14)
print(prices[["close", "rsi_14"]].tail())
```

Downloaded data frames use lower-case ``snake_case`` column names. With
``yfinance`` version ``0.2.51`` and later, the ``close`` column already reflects
dividends and stock splits, so no separate adjusted closing price column is
provided. Downstream code should refer to columns using this standardized
style. The ``load_price_data`` helper applies the same normalization to CSV
files by converting headers to lowercase ``snake_case`` and stripping common
suffixes such as ``_price``. If multiple headers normalize to the same label,
only the first is preserved.

For example, a file with the header ``Date,Open,Close,Adj Close,Close Price``
loads as:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from stock_indicator.strategy import load_price_data

frame = load_price_data(Path("prices.csv"))
print(frame.columns)
# Index(['open', 'close', 'adj_close'], dtype='object')
```

Both ``Close`` and ``Close Price`` map to ``close``, so ``Close Price`` is
discarded.

### Command Line Example
Stock Indicator also includes a command line interface for generating trade signals from historical price data.

```bash
python -m stock_indicator.cli --symbol AAPL --start 2023-01-01 --end 2023-06-01 --strategy sma --output trades.csv
```

* `--symbol` — ticker symbol of the stock to analyze.
* `--start` — start date for the price history in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
* `--end` — end date for the price history in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
* `--strategy` — indicator or strategy to apply, such as `sma` for simple moving average.
* `--output` — file path for saving generated trades as a CSV file.

### Management Shell

The package provides an interactive shell for updating the symbol cache and
downloading historical price data. Daily tasks now build their ticker list
directly from the Yahoo Finance cache maintained by the shell commands, so no
manual text file management is required.

```bash
python -m stock_indicator.manage

(stock-indicator) update_symbols
(stock-indicator) update_data_from_yf AAPL 2024-01-01 2024-02-01
(stock-indicator) update_all_data_from_yf 2024-01-01 2024-02-01
(stock-indicator) exit
```

* `update_symbols` downloads the latest list of available ticker symbols from the SEC `company_tickers.json` dataset (via the sector pipeline integration) and writes `data/symbols.txt`.
* `update_data_from_yf SYMBOL START END` saves historical data for the given symbol to
  `data/<SYMBOL>.csv`. ``END`` is inclusive.
* `update_all_data_from_yf START END` performs the download for every cached symbol.
  ``END`` is inclusive.
* `find_history_signal [DATE] DOLLAR_VOLUME_FILTER BUY_STRATEGY SELL_STRATEGY
  STOP_LOSS` or `find_history_signal [DATE] DOLLAR_VOLUME_FILTER STOP_LOSS
  strategy=ID` recalculates the entry and exit signals for `DATE`. The first
  form supplies explicit buy and sell strategy names, while the second
  references a strategy set identifier (see Strategy Sets below). Omitting
  `DATE` refreshes data for all cached symbols and evaluates the most recent
  trading day. The command now reports the signals generated on the supplied
  day without shifting them to the next trading day. Trades based on those
  signals still execute at the following day's open. Signal calculation uses
  the same group dynamic ratio and Top-N rule as `start_simulate`.

For example:

```bash
(stock-indicator) find_history_signal 2024-01-10 dollar_volume>1 1.0 strategy=default
entry signals: ['AAA', 'BBB']
exit signals: ['CCC', 'DDD']
budget suggestions: {'AAA': 500.0, 'BBB': 500.0}
```

Simulation commands interpret dates as trade days. A signal generated on
`2024-01-10` leads to an order on `2024-01-11` when running `start_simulate`,
whereas `find_history_signal 2024-01-10 ...` lists the signals produced on
`2024-01-10` itself. This example contrasts the two modes:

```bash
(stock-indicator) start_simulate start=2024-01-10 dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross ema_sma_cross
# trades execute on 2024-01-11
(stock-indicator) find_history_signal 2024-01-10 dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross ema_sma_cross 1.0
entry signals: ['AAA']
exit signals: ['BBB']
```

To refresh data for all cached symbols and compute today's signals, run
`find_history_signal` without a date:

```bash
(stock-indicator) find_history_signal dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross ema_sma_cross 1.0
entry signals: ['AAA']
exit signals: ['BBB']
budget suggestions: {'AAA': 500.0}
```

Developers can also call `daily_job.find_history_signal("2024-01-10", "dollar_volume>1", "ema_sma_cross", "ema_sma_cross", 1.0)` to compute
the same data from Python code. This function recalculates signals rather than
reading them from log files. Passing ``None`` as the first argument evaluates
the most recent trading day. Signal calculation uses the same group dynamic
ratio and Top-N rule as `start_simulate`.

The shell can also simulate trading strategies. The `dollar_volume` filter
accepts a minimum threshold in millions, a percentage of total market volume,
and a ranking when combined with a comma. The command below evaluates
`ftd_ema_sma_cross` using only the six symbols whose 50-day average dollar
volume exceeds 10,000 million:

```bash
(stock-indicator) start_simulate starting_cash=5000 withdraw=1000 dollar_volume>10000,6th strategy=default 1.0 true
```

Here `dollar_volume>10000,6th` first drops symbols below the threshold and then
selects the six highest-volume symbols from the remainder. The tests
`tests/test_manage.py::test_start_simulate_dollar_volume_threshold_and_rank` and
`tests/test_strategy.py::test_evaluate_combined_strategy_dollar_volume_filter_and_rank`
demonstrate this combined syntax.

The filter optionally accepts a trailing `PickM` segment to allow multiple
symbols from the same sector when a ranking is used. For example
`dollar_volume>1%,Top3,Pick2` selects the top three symbols by dollar volume
with at most two symbols drawn from any single Fama–French group.

An optional stop loss value and a trailing `True` or `False` flag may be added
after the strategy names. The numeric stop loss sets the fractional decline
that triggers an exit on the next day's open, and the boolean flag controls
whether individual trade details are printed.

Strategies may also limit the simple moving average slope. These identifiers follow the `ema_sma_signal_with_slope_n_k` pattern where `n` and `k` are the lower and upper slope bounds. The bounds accept negative or positive floating-point numbers. For example:

```bash
(stock-indicator) start_simulate dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_-5.7_50.2 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_-5.7_50.2
```

You can combine slope bounds with a custom EMA/SMA window size by placing the integer before the bounds:

```bash
(stock-indicator) start_simulate dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40_-5.7_50.2 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40_-5.7_50.2
```

For experimentation, the `ema_sma_cross_testing` strategy offers the same
optional window size and slope range suffixes. It omits the long-term simple
moving average requirement and additionally filters signals using chip
concentration metrics. Strategy names follow the pattern
`ema_sma_cross_testing_<window>_<lower>_<upper>_<near_min>,<near_max>_<above_min>,<above_max>`, where:

* `<window>` — EMA and SMA window size (default `40`).
* `<lower>` and `<upper>` — inclusive bounds for the simple moving average angle in degrees (defaults `-16.7` and `65`).
* `<near_min>` and `<near_max>` — inclusive bounds for the fraction of volume near the current price (default `0.0`–`0.12`).
* `<above_min>` and `<above_max>` — inclusive bounds for the fraction of volume above the current price (default `0.0`–`0.10`).

Example with custom chip concentration ranges:

```bash
(stock-indicator) start_simulate dollar_volume>1 \
  ema_sma_cross_testing_40_-16.7_65_0.1,0.2_0.05,0.15 \
  ema_sma_cross_testing_40_-16.7_65_0.1,0.2_0.05,0.15
```

When omitted, the window size defaults to 40 days.

### Strategy Sets

Define named strategy pairs in `data/strategy_sets.csv` and reference them
with `strategy=ID`.

- CSV columns: `strategy_id,buy,sell`
- Example:

```
strategy_id,buy,sell
default,ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40,ema_sma_cross_with_slope_50
s1,ema_shift_cross_with_slope_35,ema_shift_cross_with_slope_35
```

Shorthand forms using a strategy id (omit explicit buy/sell tokens):

- Start simulate
  - `start_simulate [starting_cash=...] [withdraw=...] [start=YYYY-MM-DD] [margin=NUMBER] DOLLAR_VOLUME_FILTER [STOP_LOSS] [SHOW_DETAILS] strategy=ID [group=1,2,...]`
- Single symbol
  - `start_simulate_single_symbol symbol=QQQ [starting_cash=...] [withdraw=...] [start=YYYY-MM-DD] [STOP_LOSS] [SHOW_DETAILS] strategy=ID`
- N symbols
  - `start_simulate_n_symbol symbols=QQQ,SPY [starting_cash=...] [withdraw=...] [start=YYYY-MM-DD] [STOP_LOSS] [SHOW_DETAILS] strategy=ID`
- Find signal
- `find_history_signal DATE DOLLAR_VOLUME_FILTER STOP_LOSS strategy=ID [group=1,2,...]` — signal calculation uses the same group dynamic ratio and Top-N rule as `start_simulate`.

Notes:
- When `strategy=ID` is present, do not include explicit `BUY`/`SELL` tokens.
- Strategy ids are read from `data/strategy_sets.csv` at runtime.

The tests `tests/test_manage.py::test_start_simulate_accepts_slope_range_strategy_names` and `tests/test_strategy.py::test_evaluate_combined_strategy_passes_slope_range` demonstrate the slope-bound syntax. The former shows that `start_simulate` recognizes strategy identifiers with slope ranges, while the latter verifies that the evaluation function passes the provided bounds to the strategy implementation.

The summary printed after each simulation includes the maximum drawdown. This
value represents the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value over the
test period and is expressed as a percentage.

To express the threshold as a percentage of total market dollar volume, use a
percent sign. For example `dollar_volume>1%` retains only symbols whose
50-day average dollar volume is greater than one percent of the combined
volume across all symbols.

## Sector Classification Pipeline

The module `stock_indicator.sector_pipeline.pipeline` creates a data set that
links ticker symbols to Standard Industrial Classification codes and
Fama-French industry groups. Each run of
`build_sector_classification_dataset` caches SEC submission data in
`cache/submissions` and records its configuration in `cache/last_run.json`.
Calling `update_latest_dataset` later reloads that configuration and rebuilds
the output while reusing the cached submissions, so only new symbols require
additional downloads. If no prior configuration exists, the pipeline falls back
to the bundled default mapping at `data/sic_to_ff.csv` so it runs out of the box.
The resulting table is written to
`data/symbols_with_sector.parquet` and can also be exported as a CSV file.
The ticker universe is always derived from the SEC `company_tickers.json`
dataset and cannot be overridden with a custom list.

### Automating Sector Refreshes

Two helper scripts under `scripts/` wrap the management shell for automated data updates:

- `scripts/init_sector.sh` — one-time or manual rebuild that accepts a mapping source URL (or file path) and optional output path. The script activates the virtual environment, exports a default `SEC_USER_AGENT`, and runs `python -m stock_indicator.manage update_sector_data --ff-map-url=URL OUTPUT_PATH`.
- `scripts/update_data_cron.sh` — cron-oriented wrapper that replays the cached sector configuration, refreshes `data/symbols.txt`, and downloads historical price data. By default it reloads the prior calendar year's history (rolling window). Export `HISTORICAL_START_DATE=1990-01-01` to trigger the full backtest range, and optionally override `HISTORICAL_END_DATE`. Each run is appended to `logs/update_data_pipeline.log`, and the log notes which mode ran.

Example cron entry that refreshes the dataset every five minutes:

```
*/5 * * * * /Users/you/JimGit/stock_indicator/scripts/update_data_cron.sh
```

Adjust the schedule to suit your environment and make sure `SEC_USER_AGENT` contains a valid contact per SEC guidance.
