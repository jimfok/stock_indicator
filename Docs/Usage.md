# Usage

To evaluate the FTD EMA and SMA cross strategy in the management shell, call:

```
start_simulate start=1990-01-01 dollar_volume>50 ftd_ema_sma_cross ftd_ema_sma_cross
```

To require that a symbol's 50-day average dollar volume exceeds one percent of
the market total, use:

```
start_simulate dollar_volume>1% ftd_ema_sma_cross ftd_ema_sma_cross
```

To restrict simulation to the six symbols with the highest 50-day average dollar
volume, use:

```
start_simulate dollar_volume=6th ftd_ema_sma_cross ftd_ema_sma_cross
```

To apply both a minimum dollar volume and a ranking filter, combine them:

```
start_simulate starting_cash=5000 withdraw=1000 dollar_volume>10000,6th ftd_ema_sma_cross ftd_ema_sma_cross
```

The optional `start` argument sets the simulation start date, `starting_cash`
sets the initial portfolio balance, and `withdraw` deducts a fixed amount at
each year end. The `dollar_volume` clause accepts a `>` threshold expressed in
millions or as a percentage using `%`, and an `=Nth` ranking. When both are
separated by a comma, the parser applies them sequentially. The command above
first filters symbols to those whose 50-day average dollar volume exceeds
10,000 million and then selects the six symbols with the highest remaining
averages. The tests
`tests/test_manage.py::test_start_simulate_dollar_volume_threshold_and_rank` and
`tests/test_strategy.py::test_evaluate_combined_strategy_dollar_volume_filter_and_rank`
exercise this combined syntax.

A numeric stop loss and a trailing `True` or `False` flag may follow the
strategy names. The stop loss specifies the fractional decline that triggers an
exit on the next day's open, and the boolean flag controls whether individual
trade details are printed.

The simulation report lists the maximum drawdown alongside other metrics. This
percentage indicates the greatest decline from any previous portfolio peak.

The previous `start_ftd_ema_sma_cross` command has been removed.
Use `start_simulate` with `ftd_ema_sma_cross` for both the buying and
selling strategies instead.

## Recalculating signals

Each execution of the daily job records entry and exit signals in a log file in
the project's `logs` directory using the `<YYYY-MM-DD>.log` naming convention.
The `find_signal` command recalculates the signals for a specific date rather than reading the log files.
Signal calculation uses the same group dynamic ratio and Top-N rule as `start_simulate`.
The management shell can compute signals for a specific day with either form:

```
find_signal DATE DOLLAR_VOLUME_FILTER BUY_STRATEGY SELL_STRATEGY STOP_LOSS
find_signal DATE DOLLAR_VOLUME_FILTER STOP_LOSS strategy=ID
```

Accepted forms are `BUY SELL STOP_LOSS` or `STOP_LOSS strategy=ID`. The command
prints the entry signal list on the first line and the exit signal list on the
second line. For example:

```
find_signal 2024-01-10 dollar_volume>1 1.0 strategy=default
['AAA', 'BBB']
['CCC', 'DDD']
```

Developers may call `daily_job.find_signal("2024-01-10", "dollar_volume>1", "ema_sma_cross", "ema_sma_cross", 1.0)` to compute
the same values from Python code. This function also recalculates signals
instead of reading log files.

## Available strategies

The `start_simulate` command accepts the following strategies:

* `ema_sma_cross`
* `20_50_sma_cross`
* `ema_sma_cross_and_rsi`
* `ftd_ema_sma_cross`
* `ema_sma_cross_with_slope` *(use `ema_sma_cross_with_slope_N` to set a custom EMA/SMA window size; `N` defaults to 40. Append `_LOWER_UPPER` to constrain the simple moving average slope to a range.)*
* `ema_sma_cross_with_slope_and_volume`
* `ema_sma_cross_testing`
* `ema_sma_double_cross`
* `kalman_filtering` *(sell only)*

To change the EMA and SMA window size, append `_N` to `ema_sma_cross_with_slope`, where `N` sets the number of days and defaults to `40`:

```
start_simulate dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40
```

To limit the slope of the simple moving average, add two numeric bounds after the optional window size. Both bounds may be negative or positive floating-point numbers. These strategies follow the generic `ema_sma_signal_with_slope_n_k` pattern and use the format `ema_sma_cross_with_slope[_N]_LOWER_UPPER`:

```
start_simulate dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_-0.1_1.2 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_-0.1_1.2
```

The window size and slope range can be combined by placing the integer before the slope bounds:

```
start_simulate dollar_volume>1 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40_-0.1_1.2 ema_sma_cross_with_slope_40_-0.1_1.2
```

The testing variant `ema_sma_cross_testing` accepts the same optional window
size and slope range suffixes. In addition to the EMA/SMA cross and slope
filters, it recalculates chip concentration metrics and requires both the
near-price and above-price volume ratios to remain below 0.12 and 0.10 by
default.

The tests `tests/test_manage.py::test_start_simulate_accepts_slope_range_strategy_names` and `tests/test_strategy.py::test_evaluate_combined_strategy_passes_slope_range` confirm this behavior. The management test shows the command accepts strategy names with slope bounds, and the strategy test verifies that the evaluation routine passes the bounds to the strategy implementation.

Not every strategy supports both buying and selling. Only the first seven
strategies in the list can be used for buying. All eight strategies can be
used for selling.
